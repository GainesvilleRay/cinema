In a local pastry shop, the precious Roxane, with whom Cyrano is secretly in love, reveals to him that she loves a young nobleman named Christian. Blessed with all of life’s gifts except for romantic eloquence, Christian asks Cyrano to help him woo Roxane, secretly prompting him with romantic turns of phrase.
